# About
As a software engineer with experience in Python, Bash scripting, Terraform, and AWS, I thrive on solving complex problems and delivering innovative solutions. My AWS Solutions Architect certification reflects my commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends.

With a strong foundation in critical thinking and problem-solving, I'm passionate about developing efficient, scalable solutions that meet business needs. I have a proven track record of collaborating with teams to deliver successful outcomes, and I take pride in my ability to communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

Whether building automation tools, optimizing infrastructure, or troubleshooting issues, I'm always looking for ways to improve processes and drive efficiencies.
